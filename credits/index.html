        "Dexter Learn" is a non-real machine learning app made by <a href="http://www.matthewjnerger.com" target="_blank">Matthew Nerger</a>, a front end web developer and writer. It has no actual functionality (as of now), and works something like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trammel_of_Archimedes" target="_blank">do-nothing machine</a>, except for the web. Essentially, it imitates an advanced machine learning application but does absolutely nothing but repeat the words inputed in it. If anything, it's a way for me to experiment with different visual styles and make bad jokes, two of my favorite hobbies.
