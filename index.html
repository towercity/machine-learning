      Hello, my name is Dexter Learn. I am an experiment in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">Machine Learning</a>, an exciting new field in computer development! Unlike other computers, who can only process data (and who don't have names!), I am able to learn from user input. Pretty neat, huh! My handlers (or as they like to called, "developers") have just finished programming (or as I like to say, "birthing") me, and now they are trying to fill me with every bit of the world's information. That's where you come in to help!
    </p>
    <p>
      Please teach me something interesting using the form below. Just enter the information in the text box and hit 'Submit', and then I will learn it. It's just like a little classroom, except on your computer screen! It can be any piece of information--the distance between the earth and the sun, or what you just said to your sister on the phone. Just make sure it's not something I already know, ha ha ha, or I won't get to learn.
